          Derash is a web-based tool that prevents crime in our country. Our aim
          is to help our society at the center of everything we do. One of our
          key considerations is punctuality. As we all know, our country is in
          the midst of a strenuous effort to lift itself out of poverty. Crime
          instances are the ones that add to our country's already high levels.
          Here we are beginning to look for solutions to reduce these incidents,
          and one of them is through our web program, which assists society by
          providing on-demand assistance from police stations. We believe that
          tour "Derash" will bring about change in our dear country in the near
          future.
